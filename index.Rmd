# Tanzania, retirement, and a conquered mountain

A few things happened in 2005, my mother retired, I finished up a Masters program, and a small group of women went to Tanzania. My mom had become a world travellor in second half of her life -- she climbed Machu Picchu, slept on a hammock on a beach in Belize, spent time backpacking through Scandinavia and many, many more adventures.  Sadly, I was not able to join her on those trips, but finally, I could join in on her retirement celebration trip, climb Mt. Kilimanjaro. 

I journaled about the trip and moved it to a blog when I got home.  We spent almost two months in Tanzania, climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro, going on safari, and swimming in the Indian Ocean. It really was the trip of a lifetime.  Dip in and see for yourself.
